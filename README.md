# Large Language Models

## Tools and Frameworks

- [Langchain](https://github.com/langchain-ai/langchain) - Building applications with LLMs through composability.

- [CrewAI](https://github.com/joaomdmoura/crewAI) - Framework for orchestrating role-playing, autonomous AI agents. By fostering collaborative intelligence, CrewAI empowers agents to work together seamlessly, tackling complex tasks.

- [Autogen](https://github.com/microsoft/autogen) - framework that enables the development of LLM applications using multiple agents that can converse with each other to solve tasks. AutoGen agents are customizable, conversable, and seamlessly allow human participation. They can operate in various modes that employ combinations of LLMs, human inputs, and tools.

- [ollama](https://github.com/jmorganca/ollama) - Get up and running with Llama 2, Mistral, and other large language models locally.

- [LM Studio](https://lmstudio.ai/) - Desktop app to discover, download, and run local LLMs

- [LlamaIndex](https://github.com/run-llama/llama_index) - data framework for your LLM application. Offers data connectors to ingest your existing data sources and data formats (APIs, PDFs, docs, SQL, etc.).

## Apps in this repo

Small applications using large language models.
Note: samples were run on a Windows 10 OS using Python 3.11.5. The setup instructions can be easily adapted to othe OSes.
